# Project Overview
> During my final semester at BCIT, I worked with the MRI program head, Ray Lee, and a team of three classmates on the BCIT MRI VR Simulator. The goal of the project was to provide an accessible platform where students and practitioners can safely learn MRI workflows and procedures before entering a real clinical setting. 

> We inherited a minimally documented codebase in its third development cycle with over 50 known bugs. The main technical challenge was quickly learning C# and Unity while stabilizing the system, fixing defects, and implementing new features without breaking existing functionality. 

## My Role
I focused on improving usability and realism by fixing bugs, addressing physics and collision issues, implementing visual guidance such as highlighted interaction zones, and redesigning controls and key bindings to be intuitive for first-time VR users. I also assisted with Git merge reviews to maintain main branch stability.

## Features
- Realistic MRI Room Environment - Modeled to resemble an actual MRI scanning room.
- Interactive Learning - Users can interact with MRI controls and receive step-by-step guidance through the "Error Check System".
- Simulated Patient Handling - Learn how to properly position patients for an MRI scan.
- VR Compatibility - Currently supports the HTC Vive Focus 3 for an immersive experience.
- Highlighted Hint Zones and Item Labels
- Two Exam Types : "Head Scan" and "Knee Scan" 

## Tech Stack
- OpenXR
- Unity
- C#
- Visual Studio
- Git + Bitbucket
